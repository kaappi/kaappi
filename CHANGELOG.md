## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-23

Complete R7RS-small implementation with 554 built-in procedures, 32 syntax
forms, 14 standard libraries, 51 SRFIs, C FFI, JIT compiler, green threads,
profiler, stepping debugger, bytecode caching, and standalone binary bundling.

### Added
- x86_64 JIT backend with full feature parity to AArch64 (all opcodes,
  specialized arithmetic, function calls, self-tail-call)
- Register allocation for x86_64 JIT via lazy-store cache
- Cross-thread GC safety via per-thread heaps with deep copy (SRFI-18)
- `--experimental-threads` flag to gate OS threads until cross-thread GC is safe
- Source locations in REPL compile errors
- Sandbox escape test suite (31 tests) proving all gated capabilities are
  blocked under `--sandbox`
- Robustness regression test suite (28 tests) for adversarial/malformed input
- Error format regression tests (11 tests)
- Fuzz targets for reader and bytecode loader
- CI quality gates: formatting check, Debug/ReleaseFast optimize matrix, build
  caching
- Benchmark runner with JSON output, GC metrics, and CI tracking
- Release workflow with cross-compiled binaries for all 4 platforms
- Install script (`install.sh`) for zero-build installation
- Issue and PR templates, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Known limitations section in README
- Versioning policy (`VERSIONING.md`)

### Fixed
- JIT W^X violation on Linux: pages were mapped RWX, now properly use
  RW-then-RX via mprotect
- JIT icache flush on Linux aarch64
- x86_64 cross-compilation: integer promotions and mprotect API
- `build.zig` comment incorrectly claimed fixnum overflow wraps silently
  (it auto-promotes to bignum)

### Changed
- `thread-start!` now requires `--experimental-threads` flag (was silently
  unsafe)
- Applied `zig fmt` to all 22 source files that had drifted
- Consolidated CI into single workflow
