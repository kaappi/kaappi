## SRFI conformance

105 SRFIs supported. 11 built-in (native Zig), 93 portable (.sld files), plus SRFI 261 (Portable SRFI Library Reference) as an import-resolver convention with no library file: `(srfi srfi-<n>)` and `(srfi <mnemonic>-<n>)` — e.g. `(srfi srfi-1)`, `(srfi lists-1)`, `(srfi vectors-133)` — resolve to `(srfi <n>)`, with literal names winning when they exist. Coverage details for the built-in SRFIs follow.

### SRFI 1 — List Library

**Coverage: 95%** (71 of 75 spec procedures, excluding optional linear-update variants)

Implemented: `cons*`, `xcons`, `list-tabulate`, `circular-list`, `iota`, `proper-list?`, `dotted-list?`, `circular-list?`, `not-pair?`, `null-list?`, `list=`, `first`–`tenth`, `car+cdr`, `take`, `drop`, `take-right`, `drop-right`, `take-while`, `drop-while`, `split-at`, `last`, `last-pair`, `zip`, `unzip1`, `unzip2`, `count`, `fold`, `fold-right`, `pair-fold`, `pair-fold-right`, `reduce`, `reduce-right`, `unfold`, `unfold-right`, `map-in-order`, `append-map`, `filter-map`, `pair-for-each`, `filter`, `partition`, `remove`, `find`, `find-tail`, `any`, `every`, `list-index`, `span`, `break`, `delete`, `delete-duplicates`, `alist-cons`, `alist-copy`, `alist-delete`, `lset=`, `lset-adjoin`, `lset-union`, `lset-intersection`, `lset-difference`, `lset-xor`, `append-reverse`, `length+`, `concatenate`.

**Not implemented:**
- `unzip3`–`unzip5` — rarely used
- Linear-update (`!`) variants — SRFI 1 permits non-mutating implementations
- `lset-diff+intersection` — composite operation; use `lset-difference` + `lset-intersection`

### SRFI 9 — Records

**Coverage: 100%.** `define-record-type` is implemented as R7RS compiler syntax.

### SRFI 13 — String Library

**Coverage: 97%** (30 of 31 non-mutating spec procedures)

Implemented: `string-contains`, `string-prefix?`, `string-suffix?`, `string-trim`, `string-trim-right`, `string-trim-both` (with predicate or SRFI-14 char-set argument, UTF-8 safe), `string-index`, `string-index-right`, `string-skip`, `string-skip-right`, `string-count`, `string-split`, `string-join`, `string-concatenate`, `string-take`, `string-drop`, `string-take-right`, `string-drop-right`, `string-pad`, `string-pad-right`, `string-reverse`, `string-filter`, `string-delete`, `string-replace`, `string-titlecase`, `string-every`, `string-any`, `string-tabulate`, `string-unfold`, `string-unfold-right`.

All predicate-accepting procedures accept SRFI-14 char-set objects directly in addition to predicate procedures. Optional `start`/`end` index parameters are supported on all searching, filtering, and transformation functions.

**Not implemented:**
- `string-xcopy!` — mutation variant

### SRFI 27 — Random Numbers

**Coverage: 100%** (11 of 11 spec procedures). Full state save/restore via `random-source-state-ref`/`state-set!` (all 4 xoshiro256 state words). For exact `unit`, `random-source-make-reals` quantizes to **every** multiple of `unit` in the open interval `(0,1)` — `x·unit` for `x ∈ {1, …, ceil(1/unit)−1}`. This intentionally extends the spec's illustrative `{1, …, floor(1/unit)−1}` set (introduced with "One can imagine…", i.e. non-normative), which undershoots when `1/unit` is non-integral.

### SRFI 39 — Parameter Objects

**Coverage: 100%.** `make-parameter` (with optional converter) is exported; `parameterize` is compiler syntax.

### SRFI 69 — Hash Tables

**Coverage: 91%** (21 of 23 spec procedures). `hash-table-ref` correctly calls default thunk. `hash-table-merge!` overwrites existing keys. `string-ci-hash` uses Unicode case folding.

**Not implemented:**
- `hash-table-equivalence-function`, `hash-table-hash-function` — `make-hash-table` accepts but ignores custom comparator/hash arguments

### SRFI 133 — Vector Library

**Coverage: 97%** (31 of 32 spec procedures)

Implemented: All SRFI-133 procedures including `vector-unfold`, `vector-unfold-right`, `vector-binary-search`, `vector-concatenate`, `vector-cumulate`, `vector-partition`, `vector-swap!`, `vector-reverse!`, `vector-reverse-copy`, `vector-skip`, `vector-skip-right`.

**Not implemented:**
- `vector-append-subvectors` — composite append with subranges

### SRFI 170 — POSIX API

**Coverage: 85%** (68 of 80 spec procedures)

Implemented: File info (`file-info`, `file-info?`, `file-info-type`, all `file-info:*` accessors, type predicates), file operations (`create-directory`, `delete-directory`, `rename-file`, `create-symlink`, `read-symlink`, `create-hard-link`, `real-path`, `set-file-mode`, `truncate-file`, `create-fifo`, `set-file-owner`, `set-file-times`), process state (`pid`, `umask`, `set-umask!`, `current-directory`, `set-current-directory!`, `user-uid`, `user-gid`, `user-effective-uid`, `user-effective-gid`, `user-supplementary-gids`, `nice`), environment (`set-environment-variable!`, `delete-environment-variable!`), terminal (`terminal?`), user/group database, directory traversal (`open-directory`, `read-directory`, `close-directory`, `directory-files`), time (`posix-time`, `monotonic-time`), temp files (`temp-file-prefix`, `create-temp-file`).

**Not implemented (by design):**
- Process management (`fork`, `exec*`, `waitpid`, `_exit`) — unsafe in GC'd bytecode VM
- Signal handling — requires async-safe VM interrupt mechanism
- Pipes, I/O multiplexing — not exposed

### SRFI 18 — Multithreading

**Coverage: 100%** (35 of 35 spec procedures)

Implemented: **Threads** — `current-thread`, `thread?`, `make-thread`, `thread-name`, `thread-specific`, `thread-specific-set!`, `thread-start!`, `thread-yield!`, `thread-sleep!`, `thread-terminate!`, `thread-join!`. **Mutexes** — `mutex?`, `make-mutex`, `mutex-name`, `mutex-specific`, `mutex-specific-set!`, `mutex-state`, `mutex-lock!`, `mutex-unlock!`. **Condition variables** — `condition-variable?`, `make-condition-variable`, `condition-variable-name`, `condition-variable-specific`, `condition-variable-specific-set!`, `condition-variable-signal!`, `condition-variable-broadcast!`. **Time** — `current-time`, `time?`, `time->seconds`, `seconds->time`. **Exceptions** — `join-timeout-exception?`, `abandoned-mutex-exception?`, `terminated-thread-exception?`, `uncaught-exception?`, `uncaught-exception-reason`.

Uses real OS threads via `std.Thread.spawn`. Each child thread gets its own VM and GC with an independent heap. Values are deep-copied across thread boundaries at start and join.

### SRFI 254 — Ephemerons and Guardians

**Coverage: 100%** of the exported identifiers, across `(srfi 254)` and the component libraries `(srfi 254 ephemerons)`, `(srfi 254 guardians)`, `(srfi 254 transport-cell-guardians)`, and `(srfi 254 ephemerons-and-guardians)`.

Implemented: **Ephemerons** — `make-ephemeron`, `ephemeron?`, `ephemeron-key`, `ephemeron-value`, `ephemeron-broken?`, `ephemeron-ref`. The garbage collector retains an ephemeron's value only while its key is reachable through a path that does not pass through the value, so an ephemeron breaks even when its value references its key (the case a plain weak-key pair gets wrong). **Guardians** — `make-guardian`, `guardian?`; a guardian is itself a procedure, registering elements with `(g obj [rep])` and returning resurrected representatives with `(g)`. **Transport cell guardians** — `make-transport-cell-guardian`, `transport-cell-guardian?`, `transport-cell?`, `transport-cell-key`, `transport-cell-value`, `transport-cell-broken?`, `current-hash`. **Shared** — `reference-barrier`.

Kaappi's collector is non-moving, so `current-hash` is a stable identity hash and transport cell guardians are degenerate: a key is never transported, so a registered cell never breaks and a zero-argument transport-cell-guardian call always returns `#f`. On break, an ephemeron's key and value both read as `#f` (the value is cleared for memory safety once it is no longer retained).

### SRFI 258 — Uninterned Symbols

**Coverage: 100%** of the exported identifiers: `string->uninterned-symbol`, `symbol-interned?`, `generate-uninterned-symbol`.

An uninterned symbol is a symbol that is not `eqv?` to any other symbol, even one with the same name. Because Kaappi already compares symbols by object identity rather than by name, equality needs no special code — two uninterned symbols built from equal strings, and an uninterned symbol versus the like-named interned one, are all distinct. An uninterned symbol is an ordinary collectable heap object (it bypasses the permanent interning table), so it is reclaimed once unreachable. Per the SRFI, an uninterned symbol has no readable external representation: `write` emits an unreadable `#<uninterned-symbol name>` form and `read` signals an error on it, deliberately giving up write/read invariance.

### SRFI 260 — Generated Symbols

**Coverage: 100%.** Implemented: `generate-symbol` (optional `pretty-name` string argument).

Each call returns a fresh symbol whose name is unique "for all practical purposes" and unpredictable — a process-global atomic counter guarantees in-process uniqueness and 128 bits of OS entropy supply the unpredictability. Because Kaappi interns every symbol by name (it has no uninterned symbols), a generated symbol keeps **write/read invariance**: printed and read back, it is `eq?` to the original — the property that distinguishes SRFI 260 from uninterned symbols (SRFI 258). The optional `pretty-name` is a display hint used as the name's prefix; it never determines identity, so two calls with the same `pretty-name` still yield distinct symbols.

### Portable SRFIs (93 libraries)

§ SRFI 115 is matched by a backtracking interpreter, not by the reference
implementation's NFA, so it shares the cost profile of every backtracking
regexp engine: a pattern that nests quantifiers over the same span — the
classic `(: (* (* #\a)) #\b)` — takes time exponential in the input length
(about 16 s at 22 characters), because the outer repetition has exponentially
many ways to partition what the inner one already matched. Ordinary patterns
are unaffected, and repetition of a single-character body is scanned
iteratively rather than recursively, so `(* any)` over a multi-megabyte string
costs no stack. Don't build a regexp out of untrusted input.

The SRE syntax itself is complete. Three named char sets carry Unicode range
tables inside `lib/srfi/115.sld` (titlecase, symbol, and the UAX #29 grapheme
break classes) because R7RS `(scheme char)` exposes no general category
predicate and the library is portable Scheme; regenerate them with
`tools/gen_srfi115_charsets.py` after a Unicode version bump. `punctuation`,
`graphic`, `printing` and `control` remain ASCII approximations in a Unicode
context. `digit` and `*$` are chibi extensions, not SRFI 115 names, and are
correctly rejected.

SRFI 263 note: `(resend #f ...)` from a method inherited from a *non-immediate*
ancestor loops, because `resend` restarts the lookup skipping only the original
receiver — a distinct-origin lookup the finalized SRFI never specified. Resending
to an explicit target, and resend from a directly-overriding method, both work.

† SRFI 267 is a hybrid: the `#"X"…"X"` lexical syntax is built into the reader
(so raw-string literals work in any source file), while the port procedures
(`read-raw-string`, `write-raw-string`, `generate-delimiter`, …) load from the
`.sld` on `(import (srfi 267))`.

‡ SRFI 248's `with-unwind-handler` prompt is layered over stack-copying
`call/cc` via a sticky exception handler, with two caveats. (1) Delimited
continuations are effectively single-shot: each captured `k` may be resumed at
most once — re-entering it twice crosses a native frame that cannot be
re-entered after it returns, the same restriction as continuations captured
under native drivers (see README.md "Known limitations → Continuations"). Every
SRFI 248 idiom — coroutine generators, `for-each->fold`, effect handlers —
invokes each `k` once. (2) The handler runs at the raise point rather than after
unwinding to `with-unwind-handler`, so a handler side effect and a
dynamic-wind after-thunk of the guarded body run in the opposite order to what
the SRFI wording implies; the captured continuation itself is unaffected.
